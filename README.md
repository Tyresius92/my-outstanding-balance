## Contributing

### Getting Started

1. Clone the repo, then run `npm install`. All dependencies should be installed as a result, including prettier and project prettier configuration.

2. Optional, but recommended: Install a local instance of SonarQube and Sonar Scanner on your machine (NOT in the repo). Ensure that your PR passes the quality gate (in particular, 80% test coverage is required for all PRs). If your code does not pass the quality gate, it will not be merged until it does.

3. When you push your PR, a CircleCI build will be kicked off automatically. Please ensure that your build succeeds. If it fails, please examine the logs to determine the reason. Please feel free to ask questions if you need to!

### What do I work on?

Issues are tagged with a status, type, and priority. Some also have a "Good First Issue" label; these are issues that don't require a robust familiarity with the codebase to get started.

## I still have questions!

Please create a new issue with the `Type: Question` label, and someone will get back to you ASAP!
